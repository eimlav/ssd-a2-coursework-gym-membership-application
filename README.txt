This project requires a local instance of an MSSQL server with default login details on which you must manually deploy the STUDIO2_BK.bak or STUDIO_2_EMPTY.bak backup database file initially. This is also Visual Studio Project so please use this to run the application. Due to lack of dependencies, I have commented out all features related to the ReportViewer, so you will not find this functionality available when you run the application. I have also included the documentation file as a pdf.

STUDIO2_BK.bak : Contains SQL database backup with tables and records used in testing
STUDIO2_EMPTY.bak : Contains SQL database backup with tables and no records

  About the coursework
= = = = = = = = = = = = =
The primary objective of my Software Systems Development A2 coursework was to build a relational database and accompanying user friendly application to interact with the database on behalf of a fictional gym company. I was presented with a number of options to focus the database on such as gym memberships or booking classes. 

I chose to go with the gym membership option. As a result of this, it meant that my application would provide the user, in this case an administrative member of the actual gym, with the means to create and manage gym memberships. 

I designed the different forms the application would require, complete with details regarding the layout and behaviours of all the controls. This meant that when development started, I did not need to waste time trying to figure out the optimal way to lay out the application. At the same time, I also designed and built a database to store all the information, which was stored on a local SQL server hosted using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. The application was written in C# using Visual Studio. Past experience working with C# made the process easier than my previous coursework. However, building this application was still a demanding task, requiring a high level of commitment and the application of problem solving skills. I also assisted my classmates in debugging their own applications when they encountered a fatal error, showing my enthusiasm to collaborate as part of a team when not necessarily in a team based environment. As with previous coursework, I  was also tasked with building documentation on the project containing background information, time plans, designs, testing and personal evaluations.

The coursework introduced me to the principles of different software development methodologies such as waterfall, scrum and XP. The use of SQL has also assisted me in my university course as I have had modules in both Level 1 and Level 2, focusing on the use of SQL. I successfully managed to achieve the aims I set out at the beginning of the project. I also was able to build additional functionality such as being able to print out search results, subscriptions etc. I achieved a high mark for the coursework.
